Welcome to the OpenShift 4 Disconnected Workshop! Here you'll learn about operating an OpenShift 4 cluster in a disconnected network, or one without access to the Internet.

### Who uses disconnected networks?
Before we begin, consider a few use cases for disconnected networks:

* **Law enforcement**: Disconnected networks are private and purpose built
* **Research organizations**: Disconnected networks provide data governance 
* **Industrial control**: Disconnected networks provide a security layer for supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)
* **The Military**: Disconnected networks provide alternative, reliable communication methods

### Understanding our lab environment
Today's workshop is based on the **AWS Blank Open Environment** from the [Red Hat Demo Platform](https://demo.redhat.com). If you haven't already, go ahead and [order this service](https://demo.redhat.com/catalog?item=babylon-catalog-test/sandboxes-gpte.sandbox-open.test&utm_source=webapp&utm_medium=share-link) so you're ready for the lab exercises. 

There are of course many different options for installing OpenShift in a restricted network; this is just one fairly opinionated approach. We'll do our best to point out where there's the potential for variability along the way.

Away we go!
