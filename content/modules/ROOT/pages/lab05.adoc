= Post-Install Tasks

**Congratulations** you've successfully created an OpenShift cluster in a disconnected environment!

🪩 💃 It's DISCO time! 🕺 🪩

Or, perhaps, your cluster will finish installing in the next ~30 minutes... 😸

Don't worry!
Your workshop environment includes a previously-built [.salsa]#salsa cluster#, which is also disconnected.
You can complete this lab using either cluster.

== Are we done yet?

Installing OpenShift in a disconnected environment concludes the __"day 1"__ tasks.
However, a disconnected cluster is more useful when you make a few simple configuration changes.
These are commonly referred to as __"day 2"__ tasks.

Here are a few suggested __"day 2"__ tasks that will improve your experience.

{counter:overview}. Disable the default app / Operator `CatalogSources`

{counter:overview}. Create your own app / Operator `CatalogSource`

{counter:overview}. Install additional `ImageContentSourcePolicies`

{counter:overview}. Update OpenShift from a disconnected _Update Server_

[NOTE]
You may not have enough time during the Summit 2024 Lab Session to complete all of these tasks.

== Accessing your cluster

[NOTE]
--
Because of time constraints, we recommend that you complete this lab using the pre-built [.salsa]#salsa.lab cluster#.
If you complete quickly, and your [.highside]#disco.lab# cluster has finished installing, you can repeat the steps again.
--

=== Retrieving the default kubeadmin password

The OpenShift install process creates a randomized password for the default cluster administrative user, `kubeadmin`.
The password is printed to the screen when `openshift-install` finishes installing the cluster.

If you don't want to wait for the cluster to finish installing, or your terminal output is no longer available, you can find the password by looking in the `openshift-install` directory.

Use the available `tmux` pane to find the `kubeadmin` password for your [.highside]#highside disco.lab# OpenShift cluster.

[.highside,source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
echo "URL: https://console-openshift-console.apps.disco.lab"
echo "Username: kubeadmin"
echo "Password: $(more /mnt/high-side-data/auth/kubeadmin-password)"
----
[.output]
----
URL: https://console-openshift-console.apps.disco.lab
Username: kubeadmin
Password: *****-*****-*****-*****
----

=== Log in to OpenShift using the 'oc' command-line tool

SSH to the appropriate system from the [.lowside]#jump# system, then use `oc` to log in to the OpenShift cluster.

The pre-built [.salsa]#salsa.lab# OpenShift cluster has simplified credentials.

* A cluster-admin user is available as `admin` / `admin`.
* A non-admin user is also available as `user` / `user`.
* Its `mirror-registry` credentials are `init` / `salsapass`

[NOTE]
--
Both of your `tmux` panes may be logged in to the [.highside]#highside# system.
You may need to type `exit` to go back to the [.lowside]#jump# system.

Logging in to  either OpenShift cluster with the `oc` command-line tool will display an untrusted TLS certificate warning.
You can safely answer `y` as in `yes` to continue logging in.

=== Log in to the OpenShift Web Console

Please click on the *Desktop* button at the top of the right-hand terminal and use Firefox to log in to the OpenShift __Web Console__.
Your workshop environment includes browser bookmarks to quickly connect with both of the OpenShift __Web Consoles__.
Remember, the [.salsa]#salsa cluster's# credentials are `admin` / `admin`.

[TIP]
As a convenience, the [.lowside]#jump# system has been configured to automatically trust both of the [.salsa]#salsa.lab# and [.highside]#disco.lab# OpenShiftWeb Console certificates, but not the command-line / API certificates.

image::vnc-disco-openshift-bookmark.png[Screenshot of Desktop with DISCO - OpenShift bookmark highlighted]

[NOTE]
--
The __Web Console__ is the very last part of OpenShift to come online.
If you are trying to connect to your [.highside]#disco.lab# cluster, and see an "**Application is not available**" message, it means the installation hasn't completed yet.
--

[NOTE]
--
The web-based VNC client (`noVNC`) is a bit klunky with **copy** and **paste**.
You can copy and paste into the desktop using __noVNC__'s tool ribbon (hidden by default.) 
You might need this if you're trying to copy and paste the 23-character `kubeadmin` password.

Just click the Clipboard icon in the tool ribbon, paste your `kubeadmin` password, and then click the Clipboard icon again to save your password in the copy buffer & dismiss the dialog. Now you can go paste your password in the cluster login box.
--

// === Accessing the cluster from the command-line

// You should be able to access the API server from the *highside* system by leveraging the `kubeconfig` file the installer creates for you:

// [.highside,source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
// ----
// mkdir -vp $HOME/.kube
// cp -v /mnt/high-side/auth/kubeconfig $HOME/.kube/config
// oc status
// ----
// [.output]
// ----
// In project default on server https://api.disco.lab:6443

// svc/openshift - kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local
// svc/kubernetes - 172.30.0.1:443 -> 6443

// View details with 'oc describe <resource>/<name>' or list resources with 'oc get all'.
// ----

// Now that you're logged in via the command-line or the _Web Console_ we can proceed with the __"day 2"__ tasks.

== Install Operators in a disconnected environment

Operators are like apps.
OpenShift's OperatorHub is like an app store.
The OperatorHub is configured, by default, to show you apps / Operators from multiple __sources__.
The __sources__ include:

* Operators that are provided by, and supported by, Red Hat
* Operators that are provided by, and supported by, Certified Partners (Marketplace)
* Operators that are provided by Certified Partners without support
* Operators that are provided by the Community without support

Each __source__ provides its own __catalog__ of Operators.
OpenShift will check each __source__ for new __catalog__ data (new Operators) every 10 minutes.

When `oc-mirror` downloads Operators, it automatically creates __catalogs__ and __sources__.
The __catalogs__ are automatically uploaded into the `mirror-registry`.
But the __sources__, which are YAML files tell OpenShift where to find the __catalogs__, need to be added to OpenShift manually as a __"day 2"__ task. 

=== Add custom CatalogSources

[NOTE]
In a disconnected environment, https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/installing/installing_aws/installing-restricted-networks-aws-installer-provisioned.html#olm-restricted-networks-operatorhub_installing-restricted-networks-aws-installer-provisioned[you must disable the default `CatalogSources`].

The default `CatalogSources` can be disabled individually, or all at once.
The command below will disable all of the default __sources__ in a single command.

[.salsa,source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc patch OperatorHub cluster --type merge -p '{"spec": {"disableAllDefaultSources": true}}'
----
[.output]
----
operatorhub.config.openshift.io/cluster patched
----

[NOTE]
--
The `CatalogSources` created by `oc-mirror` only contain the Operators that were mirrored (along with their dependencies).
All the other Operators are removed from the __catalog__ because they weren't mirrored and can't be installed.
--

After the default `CatalogSources` have been **disabled**, you can add the disconnected `CatalogSources` that `oc-mirror` created to your cluster.

[NOTE]
--
The `oc-mirror` __results files__ for the [.salsa]#salsa.lab cluster# were created in the `lab-users` home directory.

The `oc-mirror` __results files__ for the [.highside]#disco.lab cluster# were created in the `/mnt/high-side-data` directory.

Please adjust the following command accordingly.
--

[.salsa,source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc create -f $HOME/oc-mirror-workspace/results-*/catalogSource-cs-redhat-operator-index.yaml
----
[.output]
----
catalogsource.operators.coreos.com/cs-redhat-operator-index created
----

The new `CatalogSources` will appear in the Web Console / OperatorHub after ~60 seconds.
You may notice that the [.salsa]#salsa.lab cluster's# list of Operators includes the `OpenShift Update Service` and `Logging` Operators in addition to the `Web Terminal` Operator.
The `DevWorkSpace` Operator is a dependency of the `Web Terminal` Operator.

[TIP]
--
The OpenShift Web Console will automatically hide the left-hand navigation menu when the browser window is not wide enough.
You can reveal the navigation menu, and find the OperatorHub link, by clicking the "hamburger" menu in the top-left corner.
--

=== Install the Web Terminal Operator

Go ahead and install the Web Terminal Operator.
Accept all of the default values.
Your disconnected cluster will pull all of the images from your disconnected `mirror-registry`.

After the Web Terminal Operator has been installed, **refresh your browser page** to see the new terminal icon it provides at the top of the page.
Clicking the terminal icon will create a terminal in your browser that is logged in to the cluster with your current credentials and permissions.
The terminal includes all of the standard `oc`, `kubectl`, `helm`, and `bash` tools.

// == Add images with `podman`
// https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/post_installation_configuration/cluster-tasks.html#post-install-must-gather-disconnected

// == Remove default samples operator
// https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/openshift_images/configuring-samples-operator.html#configuring-samples-operator

== Update your cluster

There are multiple ways to update your disconnected OpenShift clusters.

The easiest and fastest way to apply OpenShift updates is to use the `oc adm upgrade` command and reference the new version / release image.
You will use this method below to update your cluster.

Installing and configuring the `OpenShift Update Service` Operator is discussed in the xref:openshift-update-service-operator.adoc[Optional Lab].

[TIP]
--
OpenShift versions are also known as `releases`.
The list of updates, changes and dependencies each release / version provides is bundled into a `release image` and stored in your `mirror-registry`.

"Applying an OpenShift update" could also be described as "moving to a new release."
--

Before OpenShift applies any updates, it first checks the update / release's signature to make sure it came from a trusted source.
`oc-mirror` automatically downloads signatures for each OpenShift version / release that it downloads.

Another __"day 2"__ task you must complete is uploading the release signatures from `oc-mirror's` __results files__ into your OpenShift cluster.

[NOTE]
--
The `oc-mirror` __results files__ for the [.salsa]#salsa.lab cluster# were created in the `lab-users` home directory.

The `oc-mirror` __results files__ for the [.highside]#disco.lab cluster# were created in the `/mnt/high-side-data` directory.

Please adjust the following command accordingly.
--

You can add the release signatures to your OpenShift cluster with this command.

[.salsa,source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc apply -f $HOME/oc-mirror-workspace/results-*/release-signatures/
----
[.output]
----
configmap/sha256-08b8725ce619ff1855cb0ec5f5c5baa879ef3c6ab9930db300761b97d2761144 created
configmap/sha256-e64464879cd1acdfa7112c1ac1d90039e1689189e0af197f34881c79decda933 created
----

OpenShift will complain if you tell it to update to a new release using the `tag` name.
OpenShift prefers to update to new releases using the sha256 `digest` because the `digest` guarantees the `release image's` contents haven't been altered.

Please use the following commands to identify the sha256 `digest` and tell OpenShift to begin the update.

[NOTE]
--
The username / password for the [.salsa]#salsa# `mirror-registry` is `init` / `salsapass`.

The username / password for the [.highside]#highside# `mirror-registry` is `init` / `discopass`.

[WARNING]
--
Applying cluster updates to the [.salsa]#salsa.lab# and [.highside]#disco.lab# clusters, which are **Single Node OpenShift** clusters, will result in the cluster becoming periodically unreachable.

Your cluster(s) become unreachable when the update process replaces the old `console` and `apiserver` pods with new versions.

OpenShift updates also update the nodes' operating system, https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.15/architecture/architecture-rhcos.html[Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS,window=_blank].
You get two updates for the price of one!

Your cluster(s) will become unreachable again when the Single Node of OpenShift reboots to apply `kernel` and other critical system updates.
--

You can follow along with the OpenShift update by using the following commands.
